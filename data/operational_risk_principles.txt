Operational Risk – Key Principles (generic, non-confidential)
- Independent risk oversight separate from front-line business units (three lines of defense).
- Defined risk appetite, limits, and escalation procedures approved by governance.
- Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and Risk & Control Self-Assessments (RCSA) performed regularly.
- Incident capture, root-cause analysis, and remediation tracking.
- Scenario analysis and stress testing proportional to materiality.
- Model risk controls where models/tools are used in op-risk processes.
- Documentation, change management, and auditability of decisions and assumptions.
- Ongoing monitoring, reporting, and governance review.
